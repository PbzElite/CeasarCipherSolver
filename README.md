# CeasarCipherSolver
This can be used to solve a caesar cipher

The program takes in a file and then uses ascii and math to shift over all the letters with every key from 1 through 26, and one of the keys will eventually look correct because it'll be actual english

Also the file is called MonoalphaSolver because it was originally supposed to be a monoalphabetic decryption solver, but the puzzle I was trying to solve ended up being a ceasar cipher
